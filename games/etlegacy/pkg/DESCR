ET: Legacy is based on the source code of the Wolfenstein: Enemy
Territory which was released under the GPLv3 license. The main goal of
this project is to fix bugs, remove old dependencies and make it
playable on all major operating systems while still remaining compatible
with the ET 2.60b version and as many of its mods as possible.
