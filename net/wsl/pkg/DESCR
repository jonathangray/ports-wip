WSL contains various scripts that serve as a client interface to WSMAN or
Web Services for Management protocol based on DMTF standard specification.
WSMAN provides standards based messaging for systems management CIM-style
objects.

WSL is "lightweight" because it is composed of scripts (that is no binary)
and is dependent on tools that are already present on standard installation
or readily available to UNIX-like operating systems.
