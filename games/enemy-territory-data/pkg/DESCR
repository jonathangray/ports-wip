Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory is a downloadable, free-to-play multiplayer
game in which players wage war as Axis or Allies in team-based combat.
It's a team game; you will win or fall along with your comrades. The
only way to complete the objectives that lead to victory is by
cooperation, with each player covering their teammates and using their
class special abilities in concert with the others.
