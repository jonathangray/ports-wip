Device Tree Blobs (DTBs) for various ARM/MIPS/PowerPC boards.  DTBs are
binary representations of Flattened Device Trees (FDTs) that describe
hardware properties such as memory ranges, interrupts and processors.

DTB files are used by U-Boot and other firmware interfaces to provide
this information to the kernel.
